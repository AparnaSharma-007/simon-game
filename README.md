## Simon Game

In this project i decided to do a normal Simon game. It is a memory game where you have to follow the sequence and copy the sequence correctly to move on to the next level.

### UX

Firstly i tried to correct the HTML for the game, i chose to do this first as i thought it would be easier to name functions etc in my JavaScript. I decided to use a array of colours for my buttons. Once i had created the style of the game i then decided to create the JavaScript to go with it. I had struggled for a while to know what was the best code to use. Once i had created my JavaScript i needed help because nothing was working. We realised i was making small mistakes such as missing ';' and naming ids for variables in my html. Once we had started to get somewhere everything started to come together. I had to change some of my html and css to make the overall look of the game good. I added buttons in the controls circle as i know the typical actions the user would want to perform such as 'resetting the game', 'starting the game' and 'changing' the mode of the game. I also would think the user would want it to be obvious when a button is pressed so i think it is important i add flashes to the buttons in the sequences. The users would also want to know what level their on so i would want to have a level section in the controls bit so the user can see their level at all times. I thought it was a good idea to change something in the hard mode to make the game more interesting and difficult on the harder mode. My idea was to change the positions of the coloured buttons. This way you have to rememeber what colour flashed and then find what position they are in on that level. With me adding this extra function in hard mode the user has a choice of an easy or hard game. Or in some cases using meidum mode to practice.
